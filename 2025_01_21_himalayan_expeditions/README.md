### 📚 Further Reading — Dealing with Small Data & Rare‑Event Predictions

The models in this project face challenges due to small sample sizes and rare events, which make accurate prediction difficult. The following resources provide further reading on strategies for handling small datasets, imbalanced classes, and rare-event modeling in machine learning. They offer practical guidance and examples that can help improve model design and evaluation
