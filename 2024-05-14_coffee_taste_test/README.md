## **Heuristic for Finding Insights in Any Dataset**

### **Step 1: Get Oriented**

* Ask: *“What is this dataset about?”* (Survey, sales, sensor readings, etc.)
* Identify **types of variables**: numerical, categorical, ordinal, text.
* Check **completeness**: how many missing values, duplicates, or messy entries?

---

### **Step 2: Ask Questions First**

* Don’t start by crunching numbers. Start by **asking questions you might want to answer**:

  * Who are the main “actors” in the dataset? (customers, respondents, sensors…)
  * What behaviors or outcomes can you measure?
  * Are there comparisons or relationships that matter?

**Example:**

* Age vs purchase behavior
* Region vs product preference
* Flavor rating vs expertise level

---

### **Step 3: Explore & Summarize**

* **Categorical variables:** count occurrences, proportions, most common values
* **Numerical variables:** mean, median, min, max, outliers
* **Relationships:** correlations, group comparisons, pivot tables

**Visualize** wherever possible—bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps. Humans are wired to see patterns visually.

---

### **Step 4: Look for Contrasts or Extremes**

* **Compare groups:** differences between age groups, genders, locations, spending habits
* **Spot extremes:** unusually high/low values often tell interesting stories
* **Trends or clusters:** patterns over time, or similar behavior clusters

*Rule of thumb:* The more a group deviates from the “average,” the more interesting the story potential.

---

### **Step 5: Pick 3–5 Key Insights**

* You don’t need to cover every variable. Focus on what is:

  1. **Surprising** – goes against expectations
  2. **Actionable** – can inform a decision or recommendation
  3. **Clear** – easy to communicate

---

### **Step 6: Frame a Story**

* Structure each insight as:

  1. **Observation:** What’s happening?
  2. **Evidence:** Data or chart showing it
  3. **Implication:** Why it matters, what could be done

**Example:**

> “Young adults (18–24) prefer complex brews over regular drip coffee. Brands could attract this group with single-origin beans and specialty brewing guides.”

---

### **Step 7: Iterate**

* After one insight, ask: “What’s related? What’s surprising?”
* Often one pattern leads to another—stories evolve naturally.
